# prework-study-guide

## Description

To create a web page which will help us build a study guide that is visible from anywhere.

I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while building this page.



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide will break up my notes into four parts.

-HTML
-CSS
-Git
-Javasript

By uploading my notes into this page, I can easily view topics and review my notes for future work. I will also be adding to this page throughout the bootcamp.

Opening the DevTools console, I will be able to see the JavScript running for future use. This will also randomize what topic I should study now.
